# ZOO
 The project contains ABSTRACT Base class Animal.

### Animal 
it should contain properites: 
- Name

- (and maybe something els that can be used in classes further on)

it should contain methods:

## The base class is inharated by abstract animal type 
- Mammal

## In directory Contracts we add diferent types of Interfaces that classes should follow.
e.g. IName for Animal.
