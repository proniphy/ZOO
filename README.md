# ZOO
 The project contains ABSTRACT Base class Animal.

### Animal
it should contain properites:
- Name

- Origin (region/country)

- (and maybe something els that can be used in classes further on)

it should contain methods:

- MakeSound (abstract)
- ShowTypeFacts (abstract)

## The base class is inharated by abstract animal type
- Mammal
- Bird
- Fish
- Reptile

## In directory Contracts we add diferent types of Interfaces that classes should follow.
e.g. IName for Animal.
